# Word-Auto-Complete
The implementation of a dictionary that contains words and their frequency to enable word completion will be the main goal of this project. We'll test out several data structures and evaluate how they function. The Ternary Search Tree is one of these data structures.

Word auto-complete features are becoming a staple of text editors and mobile apps. This project demonstrates how to create a dictionary that can be used for addition, deletion, search, and auto-completion while also keeping track of English words and their frequency. Also, numerous scenarios have been used to evaluate and compare the execution speeds of each operation for various data structures (list, dictionary, and ternary search tree).
